    org.freedesktop.Speech.Provider:
    @short_description: A common interface for text-to-speech providers.

    D-Bus services that implement this interface can provide speech synth
    to applications that use a client library, like `libspiel`.

    For discoverability, the service's known name **must**
    end with `Speech.Provider`. For example, `org.espeak.Speech.Provider`.

    GetVoices:
    @voices: Array of voices.

    Retrieve a list of voices the provider can use. If the available voices change
    during the lifetime of the provider, the `VoicesChanged` signal **must** be emitted
    in order for clients to be notified and update their cache.

    Each voice in the array is structure with the following members:
    <ul>
      <li>A human readable name</li>
      <li>A unique identifier</li>
      <li>A list of languages the voice support represented as BCP 47 tags</li>
